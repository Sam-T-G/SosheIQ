# Phase 1: Critical Fixes â€” Summary

## What Was Addressed

### Type Safety

- Replaced all `any` types with strict TypeScript types and interfaces.
- Updated icon props to use a shared interface.
- Improved error handling types throughout the codebase.
- Updated hooks and service interfaces for strict typing.

### Memory Management

- Added cleanup to all useEffect hooks (timers, event listeners).
- Audited for memory leaks in main components.

### Security: API Key Handling

- API key is now never sent to the client.
- API route validates all required environment variables and returns clear error messages.

### Environment Validation

- API route checks for all required environment variables and reports missing ones.

### Z-Index System

- Standardized z-index values across overlays, modals, dialogs, etc.

## Implications

- Much lower risk of runtime errors and type confusion.
- No more memory leaks from uncleaned timers or listeners.
- API keys are secure and never exposed to the client.
- Clear error messages for missing environment variables.
- UI layering is now consistent and predictable.

## Next Steps

- **Phase 2: Important Fixes (Short-term)**
  - Implement error boundaries for React components.
  - Standardize error messages and user feedback.
  - Refactor animation usage for consistency and performance.
  - Add ARIA labels and roles to all interactive elements.
  - Ensure keyboard navigation and focus management.
