# SosheIQ v2.1 Release Notes

**Date:** 2025-07-07

---

## Overview

SosheIQ 2.1 delivers a major leap in user experience, realism, and technical polish. This release focuses on animation, persona customization, and prompt logic, while maintaining the robust authentication and caching foundation established in 2.0.

---

## 1. Persona & Trait System Overhaul

- **Expanded Trait Palette:**

  - The AI personality system now features a scientifically anchored, richly expanded trait palette.
  - Traits are grouped by six psychological dimensions (e.g., Social Orientation, Communication Tone, Emotional Temperature) for nuanced persona creation.
  - Each trait now includes a clear, user-friendly tooltip description for accessibility and clarity.
  - Duplicates across categories have been eliminated for a cleaner, more intuitive selection experience.
  - Users may also type a fully custom personality description, with clear guidance in the UI.

- **Age Bracket & Custom Age Improvements:**
  - The minimum age for custom personas is now 18, and the "Teenager (13-17)" bracket has been removed for compliance and clarity.

---

## 2. Animation & UI Polish

- **Cinematic Loading & Session Screens:**

  - Both the initial app loading screen and the in-session loading screen now feature world-class, spring-based fade-in animations for the header and footer, ensuring a seamless and modern user experience.
  - All major UI transitions leverage Framer Motion for smooth, accessible, and performant animation.

- **Custom Tooltips:**

  - Trait tooltips are now implemented with a custom, animated, accessible tooltip component (using Framer Motion), ensuring tooltips are never blocked by stacking or overflow issues and are visually consistent across devices.

- **Replay & Visual Cues:**
  - The replay button and other interactive cues now feature animated, polished transitions and ripple effects for enhanced feedback.

---

## 3. Prompt Logic & AI Improvements

- **Prompt Compartmentalization:**

  - All AI prompt construction logic has been centralized in a new `promptService.ts` module, ensuring maintainability, testability, and future extensibility.
  - Components and services now use this abstraction for all prompt-related operations.

- **Persona Prompting:**

  - Persona and scenario details are now passed to the AI in a more structured, extensible format, supporting richer and more realistic role-play.

- **Testing & Type Safety:**
  - New and improved tests for prompt construction and response parsing.
  - TypeScript types for all major prompt and response structures have been reviewed and strengthened.

---

## 4. UI/UX & Accessibility Enhancements

- **Consistent Theming:**
  - All tooltips, overlays, and modal elements are visually consistent and accessible, with dark theme support and proper z-index management.
- **Accessibility:**
  - All interactive elements (including tooltips and replay buttons) are keyboard-accessible and screen reader friendly.

---

## 5. Bug Fixes & Technical Improvements

- Numerous bug fixes and UI refinements, including:
  - Animation synchronization and performance improvements.
  - Mobile and desktop layout fixes.
  - Improved error handling and loading state management.
  - Codebase cleanup and organization for easier future development.

---

## 6. Migration & Upgrade Notes

- No breaking changes to authentication or core data models.
- All trait and persona data will be automatically migrated to the new structure.
- Developers should now use the new `LoadingScreen` component and the canonical trait mapping for all persona-related features.
