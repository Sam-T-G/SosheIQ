# SosheIQ v2.1 Release Notes

**Date:** 2025-07-07

---

## Overview

SosheIQ 2.1 delivers a major leap in user experience, realism, and technical polish. This release focuses on animation, persona customization, and prompt logic, while maintaining the robust authentication and caching foundation established in 2.0.

---

## 1. Persona & Trait System Overhaul

- **Expanded Trait Palette:**

  - The AI personality system now features a scientifically anchored, richly expanded trait palette.
  - Traits are grouped by six psychological dimensions (e.g., Social Orientation, Communication Tone, Emotional Temperature) for nuanced persona creation.
  - Each trait now includes a clear, user-friendly tooltip description for accessibility and clarity.
  - Duplicates across categories have been eliminated for a cleaner, more intuitive selection experience.
  - Users may also type a fully custom personality description, with clear guidance in the UI.

- **Age Bracket & Custom Age Improvements:**
  - The minimum age for custom personas is now 18, and the "Teenager (13-17)" bracket has been removed for compliance and clarity.

---

## 2. Animation & UI Polish

- **Cinematic Loading & Session Screens:**

  - Both the initial app loading screen and the in-session loading screen now feature world-class, spring-based fade-in animations for the header and footer, ensuring a seamless and modern user experience.
  - All major UI transitions leverage Framer Motion for smooth, accessible, and performant animation.

- **Custom Tooltips:**

  - Trait tooltips are now implemented with a custom, animated, accessible tooltip component (using Framer Motion), ensuring tooltips are never blocked by stacking or overflow issues and are visually consistent across devices.

- **Replay & Visual Cues:**
  - The replay button and other interactive cues now feature animated, polished transitions and ripple effects for enhanced feedback.

---

## 3. Prompt Logic & AI Improvements

- **Prompt Compartmentalization:**

  - All AI prompt construction logic has been centralized in a new `promptService.ts` module, ensuring maintainability, testability, and future extensibility.
  - Components and services now use this abstraction for all prompt-related operations.

- **Persona Prompting:**

  - Persona and scenario details are now passed to the AI in a more structured, extensible format, supporting richer and more realistic role-play.

- **Testing & Type Safety:**
  - New and improved tests for prompt construction and response parsing.
  - TypeScript types for all major prompt and response structures have been reviewed and strengthened.

---

## 4. UI/UX & Accessibility Enhancements

- **Consistent Theming:**
  - All tooltips, overlays, and modal elements are visually consistent and accessible, with dark theme support and proper z-index management.
- **Accessibility:**
  - All interactive elements (including tooltips and replay buttons) are keyboard-accessible and screen reader friendly.

---

## 5. Bug Fixes & Technical Improvements

- Numerous bug fixes and UI refinements, including:
  - Animation synchronization and performance improvements.
  - Mobile and desktop layout fixes.
  - Improved error handling and loading state management.
  - Codebase cleanup and organization for easier future development.

---

## 6. Migration & Upgrade Notes

- No breaking changes to authentication or core data models.
- All trait and persona data will be automatically migrated to the new structure.
- Developers should now use the new `LoadingScreen` component and the canonical trait mapping for all persona-related features.

## [2.1.1] - Persona Generation Overhaul (2024-07-08)

### Added

- **Dynamic Persona Inference:** The persona generation system now infers missing details (name, gender, culture, etc.) using a new utility, ensuring all personas are complete and contextually accurate.
- **Culture/Gender-Aware Name Generation:** Names are now generated using a new `cultureNameData` structure, supporting male, female, and neutral names for multiple cultures (e.g., Japanese, Italian-American, Nigerian, French, Korean, Spanish, Chinese, American). If a user provides a culture or race, the generated name will match; otherwise, sensible defaults are used.
- **Consistent Persona Storage:** All inferred persona details are stored in the local `ScenarioDetails` structure, making them accessible throughout the app without relying on conversational context.
- **SetupScreen & GuidedSetup Improvements:** Both setup flows now use the new logic for random name generation, ensuring that the "Suggest" button and final persona are always context-aware.
- **PromptService & GeminiService Integration:** The AI prompt construction now always uses fully-inferred persona details, guaranteeing that the AI's name, visuals, and backstory are consistent with user-specified and inferred parameters.

### Changed

- **Persona Visuals:** Visuals generated for the persona now always match the inferred gender, culture, and other parameters, improving realism and immersion.
- **Documentation:** Added and updated documentation to reflect the new persona generation logic and data structures.

### Fixed

- **Edge Cases:** Fixed issues where missing persona fields could result in inconsistent or generic AI behavior.

## [2.1.2] - User Name Setup & Human-like Name Awareness (2024-07-08)

### Added

- **User Name Setup Option:** Users can now optionally provide their own name in the scenario setup menus. By default, this option is off. Explanatory text clarifies that providing a name is only appropriate for prior-established relationships, and that in natural, casual encounters, neither party typically knows the other's name.
- **Human-like Name Awareness:** The AI now contextually references, asks for, or uses the user's name in a way that mirrors real human social behavior. If the user's name is not provided, the AI will only ask for it if the social context, interest, or trust level warrants it, and will remember and use it naturally if learned.

### Changed

- **Setup Menus:** The setup menus now include a toggle and input for user name, with clear guidance for when to use it.
- **Prompt Guidance:** AI prompt instructions have been updated to ensure name usage and inquiry are handled in a socially realistic, context-sensitive manner.
