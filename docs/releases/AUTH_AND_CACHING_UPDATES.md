# SosheIQ Authentication & Caching Updates

**Date:** 2024-06-10

## Overview

This document summarizes the major changes to the authentication (login) flow and caching strategy in the SosheIQ application. The updates modernize user authentication, improve user experience, and optimize performance by safely caching non-sensitive configuration data.

## 1. Authentication Flow Redesign

### **Features**

- **Guest Login:** Users can continue as guests with a single click, no account required.
- **Future-Ready Providers:** Structure in place for Google, Apple, and Email authentication (UI present, logic stubbed for future integration).
- **Global Auth State:** Authentication state is managed globally using React Context (`AuthContext`), ensuring all components have access to user status and info.
- **Session Persistence:** Auth state is persisted in `sessionStorage` for the duration of the browser session.
- **UI Integration:**
  - **LoginScreen:** Modern, accessible login UI with guest and provider options.
  - **Header:** Displays user profile, authentication status, and logout option.
  - **InteractionScreen:** Shows user info in the mobile menu, with logout.

### **Technical Details**

- **AuthContext:**
  - Provides `status`, `user`, `login`, `loginAsGuest`, `logout`, and error/loading state.
  - Uses `useReducer` for robust state management.
  - Persists state in `sessionStorage` (not localStorage for security).
- **AuthService:**
  - Handles guest login and stubs for provider login.
  - Ready for future integration with real authentication providers.
- **Types:**
  - Comprehensive TypeScript types for user, authentication status, and context value.

## 2. Caching Optimization for `/api/init`

### **What is Cached?**

- **/api/init** returns public configuration: API key (for client-side AI), Gemini/Imagen model names.
- **No sensitive user data or tokens are cached.**

### **How is it Cached?**

- **Custom Hook:** `useInitConfig` (in `hooks/useInitConfig.ts`)
  - Checks `sessionStorage` for cached config.
  - If not present, fetches `/api/init`, caches the result, and returns it.
  - Returns `{ config, loading, error }` for use in components.
- **Integration:**
  - `pages/index.tsx` uses `useInitConfig` instead of fetching `/api/init` directly.
  - Reduces redundant network requests and improves load performance.

### **Security Considerations**

- Only public, non-sensitive config is cached.
- Data is stored in `sessionStorage` (cleared on tab close, not persistent across sessions).
- No authentication tokens, user data, or secrets are stored in browser storage.
- Pattern is safe for public config, but never cache secrets or sensitive user data in persistent storage.

## 3. UI & Developer Experience Improvements

- **Loading States:** Improved loading and error handling for both authentication and config fetching.
- **Error Handling:** User-friendly error messages and robust fallback logic.
- **Performance:** Faster app startup and smoother transitions due to caching and async optimizations.
- **Code Quality:** Modular, testable, and future-proofed code structure.

---

## 4. Recommendations for Future Improvements

- **Provider Authentication:** Integrate real Google, Apple, and Email login flows.
- **Data Fetching Libraries:** Consider using SWR or React Query for even more robust caching, deduplication, and background refresh.
- **Global Error Boundary:** Add a global error boundary or notification system for async errors.
- **Service Context:** Move AI service instantiation to a context or singleton for even better performance.
- **Security Review:** Periodically review all caching and storage logic for new risks as features expand.
